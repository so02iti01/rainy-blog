I beg your pardon for not writing down in Mandarin for I might not able to express my feelings about  this experience well in that way.

An Vtuber I followed has released a new video recently. 
Due to depression, she had been unable to continue her work, which was a decent one in her parents' view. Then she quitted the former job and restarted as an Vtuber. She was scolded and implored by them successively. What a weird behavior!

Indeed, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a hidden and invisible pain for many patients. And what her parents did reminds me of how my parents and supervisor behaved. 

Firstly, my mom became angery suddenly when I insisted that I was rational but just could not do as I wish. I saw the rage in her eyes when she realized I might have to have an appointment with a psychiatrists. I still remember the feeling of trembling on that day even several years later. Secondly, My dad does not think I was ill. He insisted I was in bad mood and it would come to an end soon. And when it comes to my supervisor, he just kept reminding me how successful I was as a undergraduate. "Will you be really okay if your advantages vanished over those who once was left behind far away by you", he gave a fatal blow finally. 

🐯🐯🐯Things mentioned above do not mean they have no care for me. My parents cried for my pains later. And my supervisor has tried his best, too.

In a nutshell, I don't mean to create sadness😺 I was okay this year and I will be okay the rest of my life for I have already realized what I truly need and cherished.  Thank you for reading. And you are so nice. 🥰😊🍧

It's time for me to buy myself 烤面筋 now and I am worth of it.
